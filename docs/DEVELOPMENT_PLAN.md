# Privatus-Chat Development Plan

## Executive Summary

Privatus-Chat is a decentralized, privacy-focused peer-to-peer messaging application designed to provide secure, anonymous communication without relying on central servers. The system implements end-to-end encryption using the Signal Protocol (Double Ratchet), onion routing for traffic anonymization, and a distributed hash table (Kademlia DHT) for peer discovery. Built with Python and PyQt6, the application features a modular architecture with dedicated modules for cryptography, networking, anonymity, GUI, storage, and messaging.

The project prioritizes security and privacy above all else, with no central points of failure, perfect forward secrecy, and resistance to traffic analysis. Current implementation includes core cryptographic primitives, P2P networking infrastructure, and a basic GUI framework.
