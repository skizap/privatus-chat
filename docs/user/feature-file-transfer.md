# Advanced File Transfer System

This document provides detailed information about Privatus-chat's advanced file transfer capabilities, including security features, performance optimizations, and usage instructions.

## Overview

Privatus-chat's file transfer system provides secure, reliable, and anonymous file sharing with advanced features for large files, resumable transfers, and metadata protection.

## Key Features

### End-to-End Encryption
- **Per-transfer encryption keys**: Each file transfer uses unique encryption keys
- **AES-256-GCM encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all file data
- **Perfect forward secrecy**: Keys are ephemeral and not stored
- **Authenticated encryption**: Prevents tampering and ensures integrity

### Large File Support
- **Chunked transfers**: Files automatically split into 64KB chunks
- **Resume capability**: Interrupted transfers can be resumed from any chunk
- **Checkpoint system**: Progress automatically saved during transfer
- **No size limits**: Theoretical unlimited file size with chunking

### Integrity Verification
- **SHA-256 checksums**: Each chunk verified for integrity
- **End-to-end verification**: Full file hash verification on completion
- **Automatic retry**: Failed chunks automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Corruption detection**: Immediate detection of data corruption

### Anonymous Transfers
- **Metadata scrubbing**: Automatic removal of identifying file metadata
- **Onion routing**: Optional transfer through anonymous circuits
- **Traffic analysis resistance**: Padding and timing obfuscation
- **No persistent identifiers**: No tracking of transfer patterns

## Usage Guide

### Basic File Transfer

#### Sending Files
1. **Select recipient** in contact list
2. **Drag and drop** file into chat window
3. **Or click attachment button** ðŸ“Ž and select file
4. **Monitor progress** in real-time
5. **Confirmation** when transfer completes

#### Receiving Files
1. **Accept file offer** when prompted
2. **Choose save location** (optional)
3. **Monitor progress** during download
4. **Verify integrity** automatically
5. **Access file** when complete

### Advanced Features

#### Pause and Resume
- **Pause transfers**: Right-click transfer â†’ Pause
- **Resume transfers**: Right-click transfer â†’ Resume
- **Automatic resume**: Network interruptions handled automatically
- **Progress persistence**: Checkpoints saved every 10 chunks

#### Transfer Management
- **Multiple concurrent transfers**: Up to 3 simultaneous transfers
- **Queue management**: Transfers queued when limits reached
- **Priority control**: Important transfers can be prioritized
- **Bandwidth management**: Configurable transfer speed limits

#### Transfer Statistics
Monitor detailed transfer information:
- **Transfer rate**: Current and average speed
- **ETA calculation**: Estimated time to completion
- **Progress tracking**: Chunks completed vs. total
- **Error reporting**: Failed chunks and retry attempts

## Security Features

### Encryption Architecture
```
File Data â†’ Chunking â†’ Per-Chunk Encryption â†’ Integrity Hash â†’ Transmission
```

### Metadata Protection
**Automatically removed metadata:**
- EXIF data from images
- Author information from documents
- Creation/modification timestamps
- File system metadata
- Geolocation data

### Traffic Analysis Resistance
- **Fixed chunk sizes**: All chunks same size to prevent size correlation
- **Random padding**: Variable padding to obscure actual file sizes
- **Timing obfuscation**: Random delays to prevent timing attacks
- **Circuit rotation**: Optional onion circuit changes during transfer

## Performance Optimization

### Adaptive Transfer
- **Network condition monitoring**: Automatic speed adjustment
- **Bandwidth detection**: Optimal chunk size based on connection
- **Quality of service**: Priority queuing for important transfers
- **Resource management**: CPU and memory usage optimization

### Caching and Efficiency
- **Chunk caching**: Avoid re-transfer of identical chunks
- **Compression**: Optional compression for smaller transfers
- **Deduplication**: Identical file detection across transfers
- **Prefetching**: Proactive chunk requesting for smooth transfers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Transfer Fails to Start
**Possible causes:**
- File too large (>100MB without chunking)
- Insufficient disk space
- Permission denied
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
- Check file size and available space
- Verify write permissions
- Test network connection
- Try different privacy level

#### Slow Transfer Speed
**Optimization tips:**
- Lower privacy level for direct connections
- Close other network applications
- Use wired connection instead of WiFi
- Check for bandwidth limits

#### Transfer Interrupts Frequently
**Reliability improvements:**
- Enable automatic retry
- Use checkpoint system
- Check network stability
- Consider different transfer route

#### Integrity Check Fails
**Verification issues:**
- Network corruption during transfer
- Disk full during write
- Permission issues
- Conflicting antivirus software

**Recovery steps:**
- Retry transfer automatically
- Check disk space and permissions
- Temporarily disable antivirus
- Verify network stability

## Configuration

### Transfer Settings
Access via **Settings â†’ File Transfer**:

- **Maximum file size**: Default 100MB, adjustable
- **Chunk size**: Default 64KB, configurable
- **Concurrent transfers**: Default 3, adjustable 1-5
- **Auto-retry**: Default enabled, configurable attempts
- **Bandwidth limit**: Optional speed limiting

### Privacy Settings
- **Metadata scrubbing**: Default enabled
- **Anonymous routing**: Default disabled, optional
- **Traffic obfuscation**: Default enabled
- **Checksum verification**: Default enabled

### Performance Settings
- **Compression**: Default disabled, optional
- **Caching**: Default enabled

## Best Practices

### Security Best Practices
1. **Verify recipient identity** before large transfers
2. **Use anonymous routing** for sensitive files
3. **Enable checksum verification** always
4. **Remove local copies** after successful transfer
5. **Use encrypted storage** for received files

### Performance Best Practices
1. **Use appropriate chunk size** for your connection
2. **Enable compression** for slow connections
3. **Limit concurrent transfers** on slow hardware
4. **Monitor transfer statistics** for optimization
5. **Use wired connections** when possible

### Reliability Best Practices
1. **Enable automatic retry** for unstable connections
2. **Use checkpoint system** for large files
3. **Monitor transfer progress** regularly
4. **Keep backup copies** until transfer confirms
5. **Verify file integrity** after completion

## API Reference

### File Transfer Manager
```python
class FileTransferManager:
    def offer_file(self, file_path: Path, peer_id: str,
                   anonymous: bool = True) -> Optional[str]:
        """Offer file to peer with advanced options."""

    def accept_file_offer(self, transfer_id: str,
                         save_path: Path) -> bool:
        """Accept file offer with custom location."""

    def pause_transfer(self, transfer_id: str) -> bool:
        """Pause active transfer."""

    def resume_transfer(self, transfer_id: str) -> bool:
        """Resume paused transfer from checkpoint."""
```

### Transfer Events
```python
# Register for transfer events
def on_transfer_progress(transfer, progress):
    """Called on transfer progress updates."""
    pass

def on_transfer_complete(transfer):
    """Called when transfer completes successfully."""
    pass

def on_transfer_failed(transfer, error):
    """Called when transfer fails permanently."""
    pass
```
