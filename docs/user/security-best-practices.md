## Identity & Key Management

### Key Generation

**First-time setup:**
1. Ensure device is secure (no malware)
2. Use trusted network
3. Generate keys in private location
4. Immediately backup keys

### Key Rotation

**When to rotate keys:**
- Every 6-12 months (routine)

- Use anonymous identities for sensitive topics

## Contact Verification

### Why Verify?

Verification prevents:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Impersonation
- Government surveillance
- Identity spoofing

### Verification Methods

**In-Person (Most Secure):**
1. Meet physically
2. Compare fingerprints on devices
3. Verify out loud
4. Mark as verified

**Voice/Video Call:**
1. Call through separate secure channel
2. Read fingerprint aloud
3. Confirm voice recognition
4. Verify both directions

**QR Code:**
1. Generate QR code in app
2. Scan in person only
3. Confirm successful scan
4. Never share QR digitally

### Verification Warnings

**Red Flags:**
- Fingerprint changed unexpectedly
- Contact can't verify
- Pressure to skip verification
- Unusual behavior after key change

## Message Security

### Content Guidelines

**Avoid:**
- Personal identifying information
- Location data
- Financial information
- Metadata that reveals identity

**Use:**
- Code words for sensitive topics
- General language
- Time delays for responses
- Plausible cover stories

### Message Hygiene

1. **Auto-delete messages:**
   - Settings → Privacy → Message Retention
   - Set appropriate timer (1 day - 1 week)

2. **Manual deletion:**
